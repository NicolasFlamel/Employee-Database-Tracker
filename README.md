# Employee Database Tracker

## Description

This project was made with the intention of practicing and developing my SQL skills. It's a content management system for companies that store and manage departments, roles, and employee information. It will store an employee's name, their manager and their role which will include the salary of that role and what department it belongs to. 

## Installation

- Have Nodejs installed (I used v16.18)
- Install npm dependencies
    - use 'npm install' on terminal once navigated to folder
- Have mysql installed
    - run the schema.sql file with your mysql shell
    - run the seeds.sql file if you wish to populate the database

## Usage

Navigate to folder where index.js is located in your terminal then run the file using node, "node index.js" or use "npm start".  Please see the [video demonstration](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1BGJIWsW1DUkSrBxJWuzDgoLk_6UR_4mH/view) for it in practice. Below are example images of the terminal and the resulting website.
